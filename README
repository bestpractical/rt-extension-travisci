NAME
    RT-Extension-TravisCI - Pull status of latest build from TravisCI

DESCRIPTION
    This extension provides a portlet showing the TravisCI build results for
    the latest build on a branch.

RT VERSION
    Works with RT 5.0

INSTALLATION
    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make install
        May need root permissions

    Edit your /opt/rt5/etc/RT_SiteConfig.pm
        Add this line:

            Plugin('RT::Extension::TravisCI');

    Edit your /opt/rt5/etc/RT_SiteConfig.d/TravisCI_Config.pm (creating it
    if necessary) using the included etc/TravisCI_Config.pm as a guide.

            The settings you are most likely to want to change are
            SlugPrefix, which should be your organization's identifier;
            DefaultProject, Queues and AuthToken.

            You will need to generate an authentication token as documented
            in
            https://medium.com/@JoshuaTheMiller/retrieving-your-travis-ci-ap
            i-access-token-bc706b2b625a

    Clear your mason cache
            rm -rf /opt/rt5/var/mason_data/obj

    Restart your webserver

DETERMINING THE PROJECT AND BRANCH
    To determine the project and branch names, the extension parses the
    Subject of the ticket. If the subject matches:

        /^([A-Za-z_.-]+)[\/ ](.+)/

    then the first submatch is taken to be the project name and the second
    to be the branch name. Otherwise, the project name is taken to be the
    DefaultProject configuration variable in TravisCI_Config.pm, and the
    branch name is taken to be the entire ticket subject.
